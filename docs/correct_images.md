# correct_images

correct_images has 3 commands:
- `parse`, which reads raw image files of filetypes `tif` and `raw` for Tuna Sand and Ae2000 dives respectively. Parse generates colour attenuation coefficients in the form of numpy arrays inside the parameters folder within the processed folder structure. the `parameters` folders are named after the corresponding camera systems to which the raw image files belong. Example `params_LC` for Tuna Sand dataset.
- `process`, which generates corrected images using the attenuation parameters from parse. corrected images are saved inside `develop` folders named after the corresponding camera systems to which the raw image files belong.
- `debayer`, which converts `raw` and `tif` bayer images to debayered `png` files using a particular bayer filter pattern.
- `correct`, which runs parse followed by process in one go. This can be used for small datasets which are being processed for the first time.

`correct_images parse` usage:
```
correct_images parse [-h] [-F] path

positional arguments:
  path         Path to raw directory till dive.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -F, --Force  Force overwrite if correction parameters already exist.
```
For parse the code looks for a configuration file `correct_images.yaml` inside the succesion of folders within configuration folder structure. If the code does not find a configuration file, it copies default `correct_images.yaml` from setup folder. The code reads camera systems, image format and image path from `mission.yaml` and automatically updates the default `correct_images.yaml` file copied into the configuration folder structure. At this point the code is ready to run the parse.

```
Note: 
      (1) Please ensure the metric_path inside correct_images.yaml actually points to the desired json_renav* folder within the processed folder chain for the dive. By default the code assumes the first json_renav* within the processed folder chaing for the dive.

      (2) image_file_list option for each camera expects either 'None' or path to a csv file which is a cropped copy of the auv_ekf_[cameraname].csv files generated by auv_nav. User may select the desired rows directly from the auv_ekf_[cameraname].csv file and paste it inside the configuration folder. Path of this new csv file needs to be provided in the correct_images.yaml for the particular camera.
```

Currently, parse function iterates over all the camera systems mentioned in the `mission.yaml` file.

parse function automatically checks for altitude values from the auv_nav CSV file. If at least 3 of the altitudes are not found between the range of altitude (`maximum and minimum altitude`) provided in `correct_image.yaml` file parse exits with an information message.


`correct_images process` usage:
```
correct_images process [-h] [-F] path

positional arguments:
  path         Path to processed directory till dive.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -F, --Force  Force overwrite if processed images already exist.
```

process function checks value of `distortion_correction` flag in `correct_images.yaml` file. If the value is set to `False` code ignores path to camera parameters mentioned in `correct_images.yaml` file and directly continues with developing corrected images. It assumes a distortion correction.

Else if the value is set to `True` then the code looks for path to camera calibration parameters in the processed folder structure.

`correct_images debayer` usage:
```
correct_images debayer [-h] [-p PATTERN] [-i IMAGE] [-o OUTPUT] [-o_format OUTPUT_FORMAT] path filetype

positional arguments:
  path                  Path to bayer images.
  filetype              type of image: raw / tif / tiff

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
                        Bayer pattern (GRBG for Unagi, BGGR for BioCam)
  -i IMAGE, --image IMAGE
                        Single raw image to test.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output folder.
  -o_format OUTPUT_FORMAT, --output_format OUTPUT_FORMAT
                        Output image format. 
```

debayer function is to debayer the raw input image files even without going through the correction pipeline.

debayer function operates either in single file or bat-F, --Force  Force overwrite if processed images already exist.ch mode. in single file mode path should include filename for the input image. batch mode works on all the images inside the path provided.

default bayer filter pattern used by code is `GRBG`.

default value for output image format is `png`.

`correct_images correct` usage:
```
correct_images correct [-h] path

positional arguments:
  path                  Path to bayer images.

optional arguments:
-F, --Force  Force overwrite if processed images already exist.
```
```
Note:
      (1) correct function may be used in case a small data set needs to be processed for the first time. correct function runs parse and process stages in one go.
```

## Output folder structures ##
```
`Folder structure for parse output`
../processed/year/cruise/platform/dive/image/camera/attenuation_correction/params_$camera_name$/

`Folder structure for process output`
../processed/year/cruise/platform/dive/image/camera/attenuation_correction/developed_$camera_name$/
```

## Example of required `correct_images.yaml` File ##

the correct_images.yaml file should be placed in the following path
`../configuration/year/cruise/platform/dive/correct_images.yaml`

```

Note: image_file_list option is for user to provide a partial list of images for each camera to be processed. The code supports csv files of the same format as that of auv_ekf_cameraname.csv in the json_renav* folders.
