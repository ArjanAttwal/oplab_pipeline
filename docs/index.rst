Welcome to oplab_pipeline's documentation!
==========================================
This is a toolchain for AUV dive processing, camera calibration and image correction.
Three main tools are used to get from the raw data to geolocalised and colour-corrected images for a particular dataset: `auv_nav <pages/auv_nav>`_, `auv_cal <pages/auv_cal>`_ and `correct_images <pages/correct_images>`_.
